            <img src = "Pictures/refill.png" width = relative alt="text of a refill screenshot">
            <p class="content">Having learnt C++ for in my spare time, as the first language I learnt, I created a hypothetical admin system for a refill centre. The admin can see all information in one go, calculate the cost of an item based off the weight, check the stock levels, and add the item to a basket (still a work in progress). When working on this project, the hardest part was using a library in C++, as well as a class. I am still working on objectors, which would allow me to use a constructor overload to update each item.

            <p class="content">Using my experience with HTML and CSS, I created a webpage of one of my interests - plant care! The project was the first for me, for CSS, HTML and Javascript. As a plant care enthusiast, I wanted to bring my passion to life, with plenty of colour, light and creative design. Using lists, I split the information to make it more digestible for a reader, as well as having a header and a footer, with a navigation back to the top. The idea for this was to make the page as user friendly as possible for a new time plant owner, or someone looking to care for their plants. </p>

            <h1><a href="https://rebekaheast.github.io/Picture-Deck/" target="_blank">Surfing Cards</a></h1><br>
            <img src = "Pictures/Screenshot 2022-11-03 at 09.31.51.png" width = relative alt="website showing a range of image cards, one larger with a surfer on">
            <p class="content">A smaller project of mine was to create an expanding card tool for use on a website, and a great way to show images! The idea was inspired by Bradtraversy on Github, and their 50 projects in 50 days. I wanted to challenge myself, and although the Javascript part was much hard than I imagined, I'm glad to say I finished the project and was able to have an image gallery of some pretty rad surfers! Click on each image on the webpage to see their full picture. This project was another example of Flexbox in action - so useful!</p>

            <img src = "Pictures/Screenshot 2022-11-16 at 12.02.30.png" width = relative alt="photo of a comment box with a green border and green submit button">
            <p class="content">This project was more focused on the Javascript integration and making sure that the comments were sent and shown on the page when the user submitted. I wanted a simplistic design that encapsulated the simplicity of a submission box for a website. In this way, the codes could be used as 'source' to allow other users to change the design to fit with the style of their website. I enjoyed this project, as it pushed my JS knowledge to the max! There's so many capabilities with the language, and I can't wait to dive deeper!</p>

            <img src = "Pictures/Screenshot 2022-11-23 at 13.37.27.png" width= relative alt="photo of a website with the webpage about movie data">
            <p class="content">Who doesn't love movies?! I created a movie directory to show some top movies, and also allow the user to input data about their best movie choices too. The webpage has a submit option for sending in own responses, and the data will appear underneath in a flexbox. The webpage has a movie cover art background to add to the fab aesthetic.</p>
