<h3 align = "center"><b>About the Project</h3></b>
<p align = "center">Hello! This project is to compile all my projects onto one page, as a visible source of what I have been working on. </p><br>

<p align = "center"> I enjoyed making the project page, as it gave me a chance to dig a bit deeper into the mechanics of Javascript (a language I'm not <em>as</em> well versed on as CSS and HTML). The colour pallete is again, a pink hue with brown trimmings to bring this page to light and show my personality through it. I also included a header about myself to set the scene. </p><br>


<p align = "center"> This was my first time using Flexbox, created with Javascript. To make this, I followed research on Codecademy and W3Schools. This was really fun as I started to see how data can be manipulated with the language, to create a design of choice. I also struggled in this project with creating the buttons. I used a Youtube video to make this possible. I think using Jquery would have been easier, however I'm looking into how to do this.</p><br>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Key Learnings</h3></b>
<p align = "center"> This project taught me a lot about Javascript! It was the first time using flexbox, and learning how to style this with CSS, which was really fun. I also learnt more about functions in JS in general. If I say so myself, I think my Google ability practically doubled as I learnt what's the best things to Google for the best answer! <em>Lots of googling!</em></p>

<p align = "center"> During this project was when I realised how important it is to write an important commit comments, as I needed to refer back to them regularly and assess what changes should be undone.</p><br>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Thing's I'd love to improve on</h3></b>
<p>1. how to stop the box to the side opening when the read more button is clicked<br><br>
2. live preview of the page so the images don't need to be updated<br><br>
3. rather than having a certain number of characters and then cutting off to a read me, it would have been great to have the option to have it as one line no matter what size the page is.</p>
