<h1 align = "center">Project Page</h1> 


<p align = "center">Hello! This project is to compile all my projects onto one page, as a visible source of what I have been working on. </p><br>

<p align = "center"> I enjoyed making the project page, as it gave me a chance to dig a bit deeper into the mechanics of Javascript (a language I'm not <em>as</em> well versed on as CSS and HTML). The colour pallete is again, a pink hue with brown trimmings to bring this page to light and show my personality through it. I also included a header about myself to set the scene. </p><br>


<p align = "center"> This was my first time using Flexbox, created with Javascript. To make this, I followed research on Codecademy and W3Schools. This was really fun as I started to see how data can be manipulated with the language, to create a design of choice. I also struggled in this project with creating the buttons. I used a Youtube video to make this possible. I think using Jquery would have been easier, however I'm looking into how to do this.</p><br>


<h3 align = "center"><b>Thing's I'd love to improve on</h3></b>
<p align = "center">1. Rounding off the images to circles and having them be the same size so they match equally on the page<br>
2. More animation on this page, or user interaction<br>
3. adding gifs would be fun!</p>
